# What?
This repository belongs to youtube channel ["Explaining every string"](https://www.youtube.com/c/explainingeverystring)

I'm making here videogame on "Monogame framework".
# How to start up?
You need VS2017 at least and installed Monogame

Need to use recreate next folder structure and use 

There are two repositories and they require recreating next folder structure to work correctly:
* Build
* Source
   * ExplainingEveryString CLONE THIS REPOSITORY HERE
* ExplainingEveryStringAssets [CLONE ASSETS REPOSITORY HERE](https://github.com/chelovekbeznika/ExplainingEveryStringAssets)

Second, open your VS studio solution and build solution. It should find, build and copy assets in postbuild of ExplainingEveryString project.

I know, I know - going with relative paths outside solution is bad but for now I'm came up with this. I'm ready to hear out better options and add it to Roadmap.txt.
